### What is this?
A chrome extension that automatically keeps the 'Other Bookmarks' folder sorted. Made primarily for personal use. 

Its default sorting rules are:
- Group folders and files separately
- Sort folders alphabetically, in ascending order
- Sort pages by date added, in descending order

The criteria and ordering of folder and page sorting can be changed through the extension popup or options page. Pages can be sorted by name, URL, or date added. Folders can be sorted by name or date added.

### How do I install it?

<!-- Install it from the chrome web store here:
```
``` 
-->

- Extract it somewhere
- Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
